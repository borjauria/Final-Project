# Final Project - Your Energy+

This project helps you save energy at home just by asking Alexa one question, this is amazing!

This Alexa skill uses the price of your electricity bill to recommend you when to charge your electric car so you can save up to 70% on your electricity bill. Turn on the oven, washing machine or air conditioning at the cheapest hours and save on your electricity bill!

## _Status_
This a beta version 0.1 of my final project at IRON HACK.

## _Getting Started_

It's important for you to know that this project is my final project. A project in which I have put everything on my side to make it work perfectly, to make it the best of me, to show that I have learned. So, if you want to contribute something, help me with some tip or have any doubt, don't hesitate and write me, we can always talk about it!

## _Prerequisites_ üíª

You can see the requirements.txt file to get a better idea of what you will need, but a little above that I can tell you that I have learned to use the following:

Pandas, Regex, Requests, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, Flask, Postgre...

## _How to use it_ üîß

If you want to use it, you can create a _env_, install the libraries that you will find in the `requirements.txt` file, clone the whole project and use the dataset 'postgre' to check what I have done with this project. To execute it you will have to open in a console the file `main.py`

## _Built With_
