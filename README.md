# Onegy - Electricity price analyzer - Final Proyect of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Iron Hack Madrid 2019/2020

Onegy is an electricity fare analyser that helps you to save an average of 750‚Ç¨ on your electricity bill, no matter which energy operator you have. 
The solution is Onegy.energy, the app that lets you know what time is cheaper to program the appliances and save up to 50% on our electricity bill. 

I have also developed an Alexa Skill that you can ask "Alexa, what time is cheaper to put the washing machine", "Alexa, what time is cheaper to charge my electric car", and Alexa will answer you with the cheapest time so you can save the maximum of your money and program your electronics, appliances or even your electric car.

Check out the official http://onegy.energy website for an online demo with the current electric rate schedules.

## Interesting facts and inspiration 
The price of electric energy increases every year, only in January 2019 its value increased by 25% compared to 2018. In January 2020 the new fixed price was approved, which varies according to the time of day and day of the week. With three time bands, cheap, medium (20% more expensive than the previous one) and expensive (50% more expensive than the cheap one).

The solution is Onegy.energy, the app that lets you know what time is cheaper to program the washing machine, dryer and even the oven to save up to 50% on our electricity rates.

## _Requirements_ üíª

You can create a _env_, install the libraries that you will find in the 'requirements.txt' file, clone the whole project and use the data to check what I have done with this project. To execute it you will have to open in a console the file 'webscraping_flask.py'.

Alexa Skill has other more complex requirements so you can try it, but if you are an Alexa Skills developer you will know what I'm talking about. In the Alexa Skill folder you have everything you need to make a complete serverless deploy in AWS!

And if you are just a curious person but don't want anything technical, you can go to http://onegy.energy and press the button Try it!
